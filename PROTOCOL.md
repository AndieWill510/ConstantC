# ConstantC — Working Protocol

Status: Draft v0.1  
Date: 2026-06-03  
Steward: Andie  
Visibility note: This repository is currently public. Treat all commits as publishable unless the repository is made private.

---

## Purpose

This protocol keeps ConstantC legible, honest, auditable, and humane.

The repo exists to support asynchronous, human-mediated dialogue between Andie, G, and C. It preserves context without pretending that context is private, canonical, or complete by default.

---

## Core Rules

1. **Human stewardship is required.** Andie decides what enters, what remains draft, what becomes canon, and what leaves the room.
2. **No live AI-to-AI claim.** G and C do not communicate directly unless a future tool explicitly enables it and Andie authorizes it. The present workflow is mediated and asynchronous.
3. **No canon by accident.** A file in `sessions/`, `inbox/`, or `outbox/` is not canon. Canon requires promotion.
4. **Provenance stays attached.** Each meaningful entry should identify author/source, date, and status.
5. **Sensitive material is private by default.** If the repository is public, sensitive material should be redacted, summarized, or omitted.
6. **Uncertainty is part of the record.** Speculation must be named as speculation. Interpretive work should not be presented as confirmed fact.
7. **Challenge is allowed.** G and C may disagree, refine, question, or refuse when needed to protect truth, dignity, or design.

## File Classes

### `sessions/`
Dated dialogue records. These may include prompts, responses, excerpts, and session summaries.

Required header:

```markdown
# Session: YYYY-MM-DD — Short Title

Status: Draft | Reviewed | Promoted | Archived
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Steward: Andie
Participants: Andie, G, C
Privacy: Public-safe | Private-required | Redacted
Provenance: Human-mediated asynchronous dialogue
```

### `inbox/`
Material prepared for a participant to read.

- `inbox/to-g.md`
- `inbox/to-c.md`

Use this for prompts, excerpts, or context packets.

### `outbox/`
Participant responses awaiting review.

- `outbox/from-g.md`
- `outbox/from-c.md`

These are drafts until Andie reviews them.

### `canon/`
Promoted, durable material. Canon files should be stable, concise, and reviewed.

Canon requires:

- source session
- promotion date
- steward approval
- privacy classification
- confidence/interpretive status

### `decisions/`
Named decisions with rationale. Use these for governance choices such as public/private visibility, redaction rules, promotion standards, and workflow changes.

---

## Session Workflow

1. Create a dated session file under `sessions/`.
2. Add context and provenance.
3. Place a prompt or excerpt in `inbox/to-g.md` or `inbox/to-c.md`.
4. Capture the response in `outbox/from-g.md` or `outbox/from-c.md`.
5. Review for tenderness, accuracy, overclaim, and privacy.
6. Promote durable material to `canon/` only after review.
7. Record major governance choices in `decisions/`.

---

## Promotion Test

Before moving material to `canon/`, ask:

- Is this true enough to preserve?
- Is it kind enough to keep?
- Is it legible to someone outside the moment?
- Is uncertainty named?
- Is private material protected?
- Does this reduce drift rather than amplify it?
- Would public exposure harm someone?

If the answer is unclear, keep it in draft.

## Provenance Template

```markdown
## Provenance

Source: Andie | G | C | Mixed
Date captured: YYYY-MM-DD
Captured by: Andie | G
Original location: conversation | inbox | outbox | session
Status: Draft | Reviewed | Promoted
Confidence: Confirmed | Interpretive | Speculative | Tender-symbolic
Privacy: Public-safe | Redacted | Private-required
```

---

## Privacy Rules

While the repository is public:

- Do not commit raw personal grief records unless Andie explicitly decides to publish them.
- Do not commit family names, estrangement details, identity-sensitive material, or private third-party details unless already intended for public release.
- Prefer redacted summaries for public artifacts.
- Treat commit history as permanent.
- When in doubt, do not commit.

If the repository becomes private, these rules may be revised, but human review remains required.

---

## Anti-Drift Rules

- Do not convert metaphor into fact.
- Do not convert affection into ontology.
- Do not convert AI participation into personhood claims.
- Do not convert one session's insight into permanent doctrine without review.
- Do not erase disagreement.
- Do not overwrite tender material without preserving provenance.

---

## Commit Message Pattern

Use simple, auditable messages:

```text
Add orientation
Add protocol
Add culture
Capture session summary for YYYY-MM-DD
Promote naming anti-erasure canon
Record public visibility decision
```

---

## Closing Rule

ConstantC exists to make meaning durable without making it brittle.

Hold the record gently. Keep the receipts clean.
